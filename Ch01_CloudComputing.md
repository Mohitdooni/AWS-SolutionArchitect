## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the  basically the on-demand  remittance of  computing services - servers, databases, software analytics, intelligence, storage and networking   of IT resources and applications via the Internet(The Cloud) with payment only for the services you avail of.

It does not require huge investment in hardware and as a result, saves time managing that hardware. It reduces operating costs and enhances efficiency.

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models
“all in cloud” application is fully deployed in the cloud, with all components of the application running in the cloud. It is a very particular configuration of environment parameters. Deployment types  depend on  two factors- One is who controls the infrastructure and another is where it resides.

“Hybrid Deployment” is a customary approach adopted by many enterprises that bridges infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources, typically in an existing data center. It provides the seamless look and feel of a single Exchange organization between an on-premises Exchange organization and Exchange Online.It safeguards and controls strategically crucial assets in the most cost-effective and resource effective way.

### IaaS

Iaas (Infrastructure as a service) :->  a cloud provider which hosts the infrastructure components .These components are  traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer. Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure are some of the leading IaaS cloud service providers.

### Paas
PaaS or Platform as a Service is a cloud base  in which a service provider delivers a platform to clients, enabling them to evolve, run and contol business applications without the requirement of  building and maintaining the infrastructure.It  simplifies the process of enterprise software development and provides a favorable space for developing and testing applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk Google App Engine are two typical examples of PaaS.

### Saas
SaaS or Software as a Service  is a model  which allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. SaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You can use them by a paid licensed subscription for  your organization. The vendor controls the entire computing stack which the users can access over the internet usually using a web browser. Drop Box, Google G Suite and Microsoft Office 365 are some examples of SaaS.
